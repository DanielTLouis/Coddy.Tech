Membership Checks


Membership checks in Python let you check if a value exists in a collection like a list, tuple, set, or dictionary using in and not in.

The in operator checks if a value exists:

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print("apple" in fruits)  # True
The not in operator checks if a value does not exist:

numbers = [1, 2, 3]
print(4 not in numbers)  # True
For dictionaries, membership checks apply to keys by default:

my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
print("name" in my_dict)  # True
print("Alice" in my_dict)  # False

Indentation Errors


In Python, proper indentation is crucial for defining the scope of blocks of code, such as loops, functions, and conditional statements. Incorrect indentation can lead to errors or unexpected behavior. These errors are known as IndentationError.

Correct Indentation:

if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
else:
    print("x is not greater than 5")
Incorrect Indentation:

if x > 5:
print("x is greater than 5")  # This will cause an IndentationError
else:
    print("x is not greater than 5")
In the incorrect example, the print statement inside the if block is not properly indented, which will result in an IndentationError. Consistent and correct indentation is essential for writing valid Python code.

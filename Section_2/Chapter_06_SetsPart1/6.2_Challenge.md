Challenge

Easy
Create a function named manage_list that takes three arguments: list1 (a list of integers), element_to_append, and index_to_remove. The function should perform the following operations:

Append element_to_append to the end of list1.
Attempt to remove the element at index index_to_remove from list1. If the index is out of range, do nothing.
Check if list1 has more than 3 elements. If it does, return the string "The list has more than 3 elements". Otherwise, return the string "The list has 3 or fewer elements".

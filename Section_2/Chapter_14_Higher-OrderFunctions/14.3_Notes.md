Recap - Email Validator


Challenge

Medium
Create a function named clean_email_list that takes a list of email addresses and returns a list of valid, standardized email addresses.

Requirements:

    - Convert all emails to lowercase and strip all whitespace at the beginning or end

    - Only keep emails that:

        - Contain exactly one '@' symbol

        - Have at least one character before the '@'

        - Have at least one character after the ‘@’

Use map() and filter() to solve the problem.

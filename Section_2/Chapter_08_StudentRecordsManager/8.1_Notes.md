The Student Records Manager manages student data using dictionaries and sets. Each student record includes their name, age, grades, and courses. Key operations include adding students, updating grades, checking course enrollment, calculating average grades, listing students by course, and filtering top students based on grade thresholds.

Initialize an empty dictionary named student_records to store the details of all students. This dictionary will serve as the foundation for the project, where each student's name will be a key, and their details (age, grades, and courses) will be stored as a nested dictionary.

Top Students


Challenge

Easy
Create a function named filter_top_students that takes one argument: threshold (float). The function should:

Iterate through the student_records dictionary and find all students whose average grade is greater than the specified threshold.
Use the calculate_average_grade function to get each student's average grade.
Return a list of names of the top students.
If no students meet the criteria, return an empty list.
Add (replace) the following block of code at the bottom of your code:

add_student("Alice", 20, ["Math", "Physics"])
add_student("Bob", 22, ["Math", "Biology"])
add_student("Diana", 23, ["Chemistry", "Physics"])
add_grade("Alice", 90)
add_grade("Alice", 85)
add_grade("Bob", 75)
add_grade("Diana", 95)
print(filter_top_students(80))  # Should return ["Alice", "Diana"]
print(filter_top_students(90))  # Should return ["Diana"]
print(filter_top_students(100))  # Should return an empty list
Take a moment to reflect on how you’ve combined dictionaries, sets, and decision-making to create a fully functional program. Great job! 🚀

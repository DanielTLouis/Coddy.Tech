Medium
Create a function named view_contact that displays details of a specific contact.

Your function should:

Take a contact book dictionary as input
Ask the user to enter a contact name
Display the contact's details if found
Print "Contact not found!" if the contact doesn't exist
When displaying a contact, use this exact format:

Name: [name]
Phone: [phone]
Email: [email]
Address: [address]
Example:
If the contact book contains Alice's information and the user enters "Alice", output:

Name: Alice
Phone: 123-456-7890
Email: alice@example.com
Address: 123 Main St
If the user enters "Bob" (who doesn't exist), output:

Contact not found!

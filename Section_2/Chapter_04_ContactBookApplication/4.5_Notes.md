List All


Challenge

Easy
The next step is to create the list_all_contacts function. This function will allow users to view all the contacts stored in the Contact Book along with their details.

Your Task:
Create a function named list_all_contacts that takes one argument: contact_book (a dictionary).
Check if the contact_book is empty:
If it is empty, print: "No contacts available.".
If it is not empty:
Loop through each contact in the dictionary and print their name, phone, email, and address in a readable format.
Expected Behavior:
For a contact_book containing:

{
    "Alice": {"phone": "123-456-7890", "email": "alice@example.com", "address": "123 Main St"},
    "Bob": {"phone": "234-567-8901", "email": "bob@example.com", "address": "456 Oak Ave"}
}
The output should be:

Name: Alice
Phone: 123-456-7890
Email: alice@example.com
Address: 123 Main St

Name: Bob
Phone: 234-567-8901
Email: bob@example.com
Address: 456 Oak Ave

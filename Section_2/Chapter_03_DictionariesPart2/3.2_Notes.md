Now, create the add_contact function that takes one argument: contact_book (a dictionary). The function should:

Get input for the contact's name, phone, email, and address.
Check if the name already exists in the dictionary. If it does, print: "Contact already exists!".
If not, save the contact in the following format:

contact_book[name] = {
	"phone": phone,
	"email": email,
	"address": address
}
Then print: "Contact added successfully!".

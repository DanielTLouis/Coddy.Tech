Checking for Keys

When working with dictionaries, you often need to check if a specific key exists. Python provides simple ways to check for the presence of keys in a dictionary.

Using the in keyword:

my_dict = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}

# Check if 'name' is a key in the dictionary
if 'name' in my_dict:
    print('Name exists in the dictionary')

# Check if 'city' is a key in the dictionary
if 'city' not in my_dict:
    print('City does not exist in the dictionary')
In this example, we use the in keyword to check if 'name' is one of the keys in my_dict. We also use not in to check if 'city' is not a key in the dictionary.

Using the keys() method:

my_dict = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}

# Check if 'age' is in the list of keys
if 'age' in my_dict.keys():
    print('Age exists in the dictionary')
Here, my_dict.keys() returns a list of all keys in the dictionary, and we use in to check if 'age' is in that list.

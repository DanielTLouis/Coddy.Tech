Easy
Create a function named check_inventory that takes two parameters: inventory (a dictionary where keys are item names and values are quantities) and item (a string representing the item to check). The function should:

1. Check if the item is in the inventory.
2. If the item is in stock, return the string: "<item> is in stock. Quantity: <quantity>".
3. If the item is not in stock, return the string: "<item> is not in stock."

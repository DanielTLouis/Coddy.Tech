Handling Multiple Exceptions



In Python, we can handle different types of exceptions in separate except blocks. This allows us to respond differently based on the specific error that occurs.

Start with a basic try-except structure:

try:
    # Code that might raise exceptions
    pass
except Exception as e:
    # Handle any exception
    pass
To handle multiple exceptions, add specific except blocks:

try:
    number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    result = 10 / number
    print(result)
except ValueError:
    print("That's not a valid number!")
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero!")
You can also catch multiple exception types in a single except block:

try:
    # Some code
    pass
except (ValueError, TypeError):
    print("Invalid input type!")
The order of except blocks matters - always place more specific exceptions before more general ones.


Challenge

Easy
Create a function called process_data that:

Takes a string input representing potential data
Tries to convert it to an integer, then calculates 100 divided by that integer
Returns the result
Handles at least 3 possible exceptions: 
ValueError if the input cannot be converted to an integer (print "Input must be a number!")
ZeroDivisionError if the input is 0 (print "Cannot divide by zero!")
Any other exception with a generic handler (print "An unexpected error occurred!")

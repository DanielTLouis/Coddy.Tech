Multiple Variable Assignments

In Python, you can assign values to multiple variables in a single line. This feature can make your code more concise and readable. Let's explore how to use multiple variable assignments effectively.

Basic Multiple Assignments:

a, b, c = 1, 2, 3
print(a)  # Output: 1
print(b)  # Output: 2
print(c)  # Output: 3
Assigning the same value to multiple variables:

x = y = z = 10
print(x)  # Output: 10
print(y)  # Output: 10
print(z)  # Output: 10
Assigning values from a list:

numbers = [4, 5, 6]
a, b, c = numbers
print(a)  # Output: 4
print(b)  # Output: 5
print(c)  # Output: 6

Challenge

Easy
Write a Python program that performs the following tasks:

Assign values to three variables name, age, and city in a single line. Set name to "Alice", age to 30, and city to "New York".
Assign the value 100 to three variables x, y, and z in a single line.
Create a list named colors containing the values "red", "green", and "blue". Assign these values to three variables color1, color2, and color3 in a single line.

How would you assign the value 42 to three variables named age, score, and limit in a single line?
1. Wrong Answer
age; score; limit = 42
2. Correct Answer
age = score = limit = 42
3. Wrong Answer
(age, score, limit) = (42, 42, 42)
4. Wrong Answer
age, score, limit = 42

If you have a tuple coords = (3, 4, 5), how would you assign its values to variables x, y, and z respectively?
1. Correct Answer
x, y, z = coords
2. Wrong Answer
(x, y, z) = coords[0], coords[1], coords[2]
3. Wrong Answer
x = coords[0]; y = coords[1]; z = coords[2]
4. Wrong Answer
x = y = z = coords

Swapping Variables

Swapping variables is a common operation where the values of two variables are exchanged. Python offers a simple and elegant way to swap variables without needing a temporary variable, unlike many other programming languages.

Traditional Method (Using a Temporary Variable):

a = 10
b = 20
temp = a
a = b
b = temp
print(a)  # Output: 20
print(b)  # Output: 10
Pythonic Way (Simultaneous Assignment):

a = 10
b = 20
a, b = b, a
print(a)  # Output: 20
print(b)  # Output: 10
In the Pythonic way, the values of b and a are simultaneously assigned to a and b, respectively. This approach is more readable and doesn't require any additional variables.

Challenge

Easy
Write a Python program to swap the values of two variables without using a temporary variable. Initialize two variables, x and y, with the values 5 and 10 respectively. Swap their values and then print them.

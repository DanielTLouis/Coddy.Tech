Smart Contact Manager


Challenge

Medium
Create a function named organize_contacts that processes a list of contact dictionaries to create a clean contact database.

Each contact dictionary in the input list has these keys:

name: The person's name
email: The person's email address
phone: The person's phone number
Your function should:

Remove duplicate contacts (contacts with the same email or phone number)
Standardize all emails to lowercase
Filter out contacts with invalid email addresses
Filter out contacts with invalid phone numbers
Return a list of cleaned contact dictionaries
Validation rules:

Valid email: Must contain '@' and '.', and must not have spaces
Valid phone: Must contain exactly 10 digits (ignore non-digit characters like dashes or parentheses)
For cleaning phone numbers, you should use Python's str.isdigit() method to extract only the numeric digits from phone numbers. This method returns True if a character is a digit (0-9) and False otherwise, making it perfect for filtering out non-digit characters.

Example Input:
contacts = [
    {"name": "John Doe", "email": "john@email.com", "phone": "123-456-7890"}
]
Expected Output:
[
    {"name": "John Doe", "email": "john@email.com", "phone": "1234567890"}
]

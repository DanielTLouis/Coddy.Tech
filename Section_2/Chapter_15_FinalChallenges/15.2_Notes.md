Word Analytics


Challenge

Hard
Create a function named analyze_text that analyzes words in a text string.

Your function should:

Count unique words (case-insensitive)
Find all words that appear more than once
Identify all palindrome words (words that read the same forwards and backwards, like "level")
Return a dictionary with three keys:

unique_count: the number of unique words (count also repeated words once each)
repeated_words: a sorted list of words appearing more than once
palindromes: a sorted list of palindrome words
Notes:

Treat words as case-insensitive (e.g., "Hello" and "hello" are the same word)
Remove any punctuation (.,!?:;"()) from words
Sort both the repeated_words and palindromes lists alphabetically
Example Input:
"Madam saw a racecar. Dad said hello hello to mom."

Expected Output:
{
    'unique_count': 9,
    'repeated_words': ['hello'],
    'palindromes': ['a', 'dad', 'madam', 'mom', 'racecar']
}

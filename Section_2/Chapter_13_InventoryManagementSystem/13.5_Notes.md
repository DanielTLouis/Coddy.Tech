Generate Report


Challenge

Hard
The inventory system already has these components implemented:

A global inventory dictionary where:
Keys are item names (strings)
Values are dictionaries containing:
"price": The price of the item (float)
"stock": Current quantity in stock (integer)
An add_item(item, price, stock) function that adds new items to inventory
An update_stock(item, quantity) function that updates the stock level
A check_availability(item) function that returns the current stock level
Your task is to implement the sales_report(sales) function that:

Takes a sales dictionary where:
Keys are item names
Values are quantities sold
For each item in the sales dictionary:
Checks if the item exists in inventory
Checks if there's sufficient stock
Updates the inventory by reducing stock levels
Calculates revenue based on price and quantity sold
Returns a formatted string with the total revenue
Handle these specific errors:

If an item doesn't exist in inventory, print: "Error: Item '{item}' not found."
If there's insufficient stock, print: "Error: Insufficient stock for '{item}'."
The output should be a string formatted as: “Total revenue: ${total:.2f}”

 

Add (replace) the following block of code at the bottom of your code:

add_item("Apple", 0.5, 50)
add_item("Banana", 0.2, 60)
sales = {"Apple": 30, "Banana": 20, "Orange": 10}  # Orange should print an error
print(sales_report(sales))  # Should output: 19.0
print(inventory)

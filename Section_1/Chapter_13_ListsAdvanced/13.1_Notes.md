List Slicing Part 1

Slicing allows us to extract portions of a list using the following syntax: lst[start:stop]. For example consider this list:

numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
Getting a portion of the list:

print(numbers[2:6])
# Output: [2, 3, 4, 5]
This gets elements from index 2 (inclusive) to index 6 (exclusive)

Omitting start parameter:

print(numbers[:5])
# Output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
When start is omitted, slice begins from index 0

Omitting stop parameter:

print(numbers[5:])
# Output: [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
When stop is omitted, slice goes until the end


Challenge

Easy
Create a program that receives a list as input (given) and prints the following sliced list:

For odd-length lists: take the middle item and one item on each side (3 items total)
For even-length lists: take the two middle items
When dividing numbers:

/ gives you a decimal number (5/2 = 2.5)
// removes the decimal part (5//2 = 2)
For this challenge, use // because list slicing only works with whole numbers.

Sequence Operators

Python provides several operators that can be used with sequences like lists, strings, and tuples.

Concatenation with the + operator joins two sequences together:

list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = [4, 5, 6]
combined_list = list1 + list2
After executing the above code, combined_list contains:

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
Repetition with the * operator repeats a sequence a specified number of times:

numbers = [1, 2, 3]
repeated_numbers = numbers * 3
After executing the above code, repeated_numbers contains:

[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]
These operators work with other sequences too:

# String concatenation
greeting = "Hello" + " " + "World"  # "Hello World"

# String repetition
stars = "*" * 5  # "*****"


Challenge

Easy
Create a function named create_pattern that takes two arguments:

A list of numbers (numbers).
An integer (repeats).
The function should:

Concatenate the list with itself (list + list).
Repeat the resulting list repeats times using the * operator.
Return the final pattern.

1: Wrong Answer
['ABCDE']

2: Wrong Answer
['A', 'B', 'C', ['D', 'E']]

3: Wrong Answer
Error: cannot concatenate lists

4: Correct Answer
['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E']

In a game, players need to repeat their last move three times. If a player's move is represented by the list ['forward', 'jump'], how can they generate the list for their next three moves using a single operation?
1: Wrong Answer
['forward', 'jump'] + ['forward', 'jump'] + ['forward', 'jump']

2 :Correct Answer 
['forward', 'jump'] * 3

3: Wrong Answer
['forward', 'jump', 'forward', 'jump', 'forward', 'jump']

4: Wrong Answer
3 * ['forward', 'jump']

List Slicing Part 2

Slicing has another step parameter: lst[start:stop:step], For example consider this list:

numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
Gets every second element from index 1 to 8:

print(numbers[1:8:2])
# Output: [1, 3, 5, 7]
Gets every third element from index 2:

print(numbers[2::3])
# Output: [2, 5, 8]
Slicing also supports negative indices.

Counting from end:

print(numbers[-3:])
# Output: [7, 8, 9]
Here, -3 means "start 3 positions from the end"

Count until end:

print(numbers[:-2])    
# Output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
Here, -2 means "stop 2 positions from the end" (exclusive)

Reversing with negative step:

print(numbers[::-1])
# Output: [9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
Empty space before first : means “start from beginning”
Empty space between : means “go until the end”
-1 means "move backwards one step at a time" 


Challenge

Easy
Create a program that receives a list as input (given) and prints three new lists based on the following slicing operations:

A list containing every third element, starting from index 1 (the second element)
A list containing all the elements from the 6th element to the 1st in reverse order
A list containing every second element starting from the middle of the list to the end

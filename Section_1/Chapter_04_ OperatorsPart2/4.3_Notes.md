Recap - Simple Logic

Let's practice some more logical operations!

In this exercise, you'll work with the and operator and the not operator. Remember that:

The and operator returns True only when ALL operands are True
The not operator flips the boolean value: not True becomes False, and not False becomes True

Challenge

Beginner
You are given a code with variables b1, b2, and b3 that have question marks instead of values. Replace each question mark with either True or False so that the final result b4 will be True.

Important: Only replace the question marks in b1, b2, and b3. Do not modify the line that calculates b4 or any other lines.

Look at the expression b4 = b1 and b2 and (not b3) to understand what values are needed.

Boolean

A bool (Boolean) type has only 2 possible values: True or False.

To assign a bool value to a variable,

variable_true = True
variable_false = False
In the above example, two variables named variable_true and variable_false are initialized, with the values True and False respectively.

Booleans are the building blocks for creating logic in the programs we write. We have a whole chapter about logic and conditions.

Instance vs Class Variables



Challenge

Easy
Complete a banking system.. You'll define a BankAccount class in one file and use it in another.

You'll work with:

bank_account.py: Define the BankAccount class with attributes and methods
driver.py: Import the class, create accounts, and demonstrate class variables
Follow the TODO comments in both files for step-by-step instructions. The comments will guide you through creating the class with proper variables, methods, and showing how class variables affect all instances.
